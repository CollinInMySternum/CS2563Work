	b.) Nuclear power plants (Chernobyl)
-Increase reliability and safety vs. Economic benefit to short development time.
	a.) Management issues: 
		Cutting corners to save money and shorten development time, leading to unsatisfactory results.
-Fear of new technology
	a.) Risk of job market impact:
		AI,
		Computers,
		CNC/Machining

Different Topics to consider:

-Technology
	-Computer Science Errors
		-Software, Hardware, Development errors
	-Equipment Errors

Structure/Layout

-Each category will be multiple slides, with hierarchy in how they are covered.
-Each subtopic should consider different aspects. Technology/Engineering/Marketing...etc.
